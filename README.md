## Stripe
## Description
Stripe is a Rust program that approximates the value of Euler's number (e) using a very fast and optimized version of the Taylor series. The program is designed to compute the approximation within a few seconds, ensuring both efficiency and accuracy.

## Requirements
Rust programming language installed on your system
## Usage
 - Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>
 - Navigate to the project directory: cd Stripe
 - Compile the Rust program: cargo build --release
 - Run the program: cargo run --release
## Algorithm
 - The program utilizes an optimized version of the Taylor series expansion to calculate the value of Euler's number (e).
 - The series is expressed as: e = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!} ]$$
 - The optimization techniques implemented allow for rapid convergence and efficient computation.
## Performance
 - Stripe is engineered to provide quick and accurate approximations of Euler's number.
 - The optimized Taylor series approach enables the program to run efficiently within a few seconds.
## Implementation
 - The optimized Taylor series approach is carefully designed to minimize computational overhead while maximizing speed.
## Future Enhancements
 - Implement additional methods for calculating Euler's number to compare performance.
 - Add support for user-defined precision levels and input parameters.
 - Explore graphical representation of the convergence of the Taylor series.
